.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fIgit subdir\fR maintains the content of an external Git repository within a subdirectory of your repository\&.
.sp
Local changes to the subdirectory can be filtered onto a branch and pushed back upstream\&. Long lived integration changes (such as to integrate an external project into your build system) are maintained on a branch and rebased each time you sync with the latest upstream\&.
.sp
Developers can clone your project and freely commit changes to subdirectories without needing to know about or use \fIgit subdir\fR which can be considered a project maintainer\(cqs tool; only needed when re\-syncing a subdirectory\(cqs content with upstream\&.

.sp
Creates a <subdir>/ directory containing a \&.git\-subdir/config file with a record of the corresponsing remote <repository> as well as (optionally) an upstream repository to monitor\&.
.sp
The <repository> would typically be a project\-specific fork of an upstream repository and is referred to as the \fIintegration\fR repository\&.
.sp
The benefit of specifying a second, upstream repository is that \fIgit subdir update\fR can streamline rebasing any project\-specific <subdir> changes onto the latest upstream changes\&.
.sp
Typically <subdir> wouldn\(cqt exist before running \fIgit subdir add\fR, but it\(cqs also possible to create a \&.git\-subdir/config file for a pre\-existing subdirectory (in which case \-\-pre\-integrated\-commit must be passed to identify a commit from <repository> that the subdirectory\(cqs content currently corresponds to)\&.
.sp
The initial <subdir> content will come from the <repository> branch if it already exists otherwise it will come from the <upstream\-repository>\&.

.sp
Replaces the contents of <subdir> with the contents of <commit> in a single squashed commit\&. <commit> should be in the layout of the external repository\&.
.sp
If the <commit> is not an upstream commit it should then be pushed to the remote integration branch for others to be able to rebase your project\-specific changes onto different upstream versions\&. Running \fIgit subdir status\fR will try to warn when the last squashed <commit> doesn\(cqt appear to have been published for others\&.
.sp
Note: it\(cqs ok to rebase these squash commits on a topic branch without confusing \fIgit subdir\fR, but it\(cqs recommended to avoid squashing extra changes within <subdir> into these commits, otherwise if you later use \fIgit subdir branch\fR you will see these extra changes split back out into a separate, poorly named patch\&.

.if n \{\

\fIgit subdir branch\fR \-b <branch> [<subdir>]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Creates a branch in the layout of the external project, and filters any patches that affect <subdir> onto this branch too\&. The branch is based on an upstream commit so it\(cqs possible to manually push changes upstream from here\&. Another use case might be to manually rebase on a more recent upstream before committing the result with \fIgit subdir commit\fR\&.
.SS "rebase"
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
\fIgit subdir rebase\fR [<subdir>]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This fetches from the configured upstream and integration repositories, then (if both branches have been configured) rebases integration changes on the latest upstream changes, rebases any local changes on top of this and then commits the result\&.
.sp
This is the recommended way to routinely pull in new upstream changes to <subdir>\&.
.sp
This is a convenience for the following steps:

Note: this deviates from the standard \fIgit config\fR <option> [<value>] UI due to the ambiguity of <value> and <subdir> both being optional
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
Lets say you have a container project \fIsuper\fR at \m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/user/super\fR\m[] and another project \fIduper\fR at \m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/upstream/duper\fR\m[] which you want to embed in the former\&.
.sp
The first thing to decide is where to maintain an \fIintegration\fR branch for any changes you might need to track for the \fIduper\fR subdirectory\&.
.sp
Lets assume you don\(cqt have privileges to touch the \fIupstream/duper\fR repo so you start by forking it and create \m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/user/duper\fR\m[]\&. We\(cqll leave the master branch of this repo alone and create a \fIsuper\-integration\fR branch that we can push to \m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/user/duper\fR\m[]\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ cd super/
$ git subdir add \-b super\-integration http://github\&.com/user/duper http://github\&.com/upstream/duper duper/
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Now make a local change to the duper/ subdirectory\&...
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ echo "foo" > duper/file\&.txt
$ git commit \-m \*(Aqchange file\*(Aq duper/file\&.txt
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
At this point the upstream may have improvements we want, while we still want to keep our change\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git subdir rebase duper
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Will fetch the latest upstream, rebase the local change and commit the result back\&.
.sp
If you run \fIgit subdir status duper\fR now you will see a warning\&.
.sp
As part of this rebase your local change was rebased on upstream and \fIgit subdir status\fR is reminding you to push the rebased branch as your latest super\-integration branch\&.
.sp
Every time a subdirectory is updated (either via a commit or a rebase) then \fIgit subdir\fR also creates a \fIref\fR for the commit whose content is used to update a subdirectory so that the commit can always be used as a base for later \fIgit subdir\fR commands\&. In addition to the integration branch, these refs should be published for other project maintainers too\&.
.sp
\fIgit subdir push\fR will push your integration branch (super\-integration) and commit refs to your configured integration repo:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git subdir push duper
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
\fIgit subdir\fR maintains the configuration for a subdirectory in a \&.git\-subdir/config file which is tracked as part of your repository history\&. These files are compatible with \fIgit config \-f \&.git\-subdir/config\fR and it\(cqs safe to modify (and commit) changes to \&.git\-subdir/config files with the exception that the \fIcommit\-uuid\fR line should not be touched since that will interfere with \fIgit subdir\fR identifying the changes that update the subdir contents\&.
.sp
\fIgit subdir\fR will create \fIsubdir\-upstream/<subdir>\fR and \fIsubdir\-integration/<subdir>\fR remotes in $GIT_DIR/ but never assumes these exist and always updates them before use based on the current \&.git\-subdir configuration\&.
.SH "COMPARED TO SIMILAR TOOLS"

\fIgit subtree\fR

\fIgit subdir\fR
takes a different approach to branching by rebasing and filtering local changes onto an upstream commit to ease upstreaming those local changes\&.

.ie n \{\

By differentiating an integration branch from an upstream branch
\fIgit subdir\fR
can further streamline the process of upstreaming some changes while maintaining other integration changes private to your project\&.

.RS 4
.ie n \{\

The use of an integration branch and saving the refs for what content is committed to a subdirectory avoids loosing track of individual changes behind the squash commits used to pull in upstream changes\&.
